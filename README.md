## areas of growth

i have ambitious plans to include more features, like a competitive play mode, wordlist-creating ability, and even an impossible-hint mechanism (retrieving definition but in russian, for instance). i finally decided against it as i want to really (hopefully) nail the basics, but i will probably realize those ideas after!
additionally, i think with more experience, i will be able to improve my code's organization and scalability.


## reflection

this project allows me to apply and build on my web-dev skills. i've thoroughly enjoyed the whole process, from designing the frontend (lots of watching css animation tutorials on ytb) to manipulating server-side's logic. i was able to challenge myself by experimenting with new tools like tailwindcss and vite, and by striving to write organized and maintainable code. i hope that when reviewing my project, Change++ will be able to see the effort i've put in, my strengths in web dev, and my commitment to grow as a programmer!
